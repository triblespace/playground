# playground sandbox-MCP on FreeBSD (server-side hosting)

Runs the sandbox provider *on* the jail host (`ai.bultmann.eu`, FreeBSD
15.1): `playground mcp-http --backend jail --jail-local` bound to
loopback, with per-tenant bearer tokens. The jail backend executes
`sudo -n zfs/jail/jexec ...` directly ([`LocalRunner`], no ssh hop);
sessions are ZFS clones of `aitemp/playground/template@base`, jails are
`playground-*`, both strictly namespaced.

Two hosting modes exist and stay interchangeable:

| mode | where the binary runs | transport to the jail host |
|---|---|---|
| Mac-driven (default) | operator's machine | `SshRunner` (`ssh` + `sudo -n`) |
| server-side (this doc) | the jail host itself | `LocalRunner` (direct spawn) |

## TRUST BOUNDARY (Model B — host-owned per-tenant piles)

- **The caller-supplied pile never goes to this server.** The
  `pile_host_path` tool argument is logged and ignored. Instead each tenant
  jail gets its OWN host-owned, server-born piles, provisioned on this box
  under `--jail-pile-root` (default `/aitemp/playground/piles`): a per-tenant
  `self.pile` (seeded from a generic `bootstrap.pile` — no operator memory)
  mounted at guest `/pile`, plus one org-wide `shared.pile` mounted at guest
  `/shared`. Both are `chflags sappnd` append-only and decoupled from the jail
  lifecycle (`destroy_session` never deletes them). A stolen tenant token thus
  reaches only that tenant's own seeded pile and the shared org pile — never the
  caller-supplied pile, and never any other pile on the host.
- **Append-only is enforced by the host, not trusted to the guest.** `chflags
  sappnd` lets a jailed process `O_APPEND` but not `O_TRUNC`/unlink/rename, so a
  buggy or stale tool cannot truncate a pile (the 2026-07-03 truncation class).
  At the current `kern.securelevel=-1` this blocks ACCIDENTAL truncation only; a
  deliberate jail-root truncation still needs `securelevel>=1` (then the same
  flag is malicious-proof with no code change — the deploy-hardening step).
- The server only ever touches `<prefix>-*` jails and datasets under its
  configured `--jail-dataset-parent` (default `aitemp/playground`). The
  `repo-*`/`trible*` jails and datasets on the same box are out of bounds.
- The HTTP server binds `127.0.0.1` and speaks plain HTTP. Anything beyond
  loopback is a deferred decision (see the end of this doc).

## Build (on the server)

The crate has path dependencies on sibling repos, so the build tree is
the standard sibling-repo layout. The server profile skips the GUI/faculties
stack entirely:

```sh
# one-time toolchain: rust 1.96 as of 2026-07; rsync for the source sync
sudo pkg install -y rust rsync

# sync the source closure from the operator machine — NOTE the
# --exclude='*.pile': NO pile file may land on this server, ever.
# (Manifests of optional path deps must exist for cargo resolution even
# though they are not built: GORBIE, mary, cubecl-fork, gorbie_commonmark.)
rsync -a --delete \
  --exclude 'target/' --exclude '.git/' --exclude '.claude/' \
  --exclude '*.pile' --exclude 'models/' --exclude 'weights/' \
  --exclude '__pycache__/' \
  playground faculties triblespace-rs GORBIE mary cubecl-fork gorbie_commonmark \
  ai.bultmann.eu:playground-build/

# verify the pile rail held before anything else:
ssh ai.bultmann.eu "find playground-build -name '*.pile'"   # must print nothing

cd ~/playground-build/playground
cargo build --release --locked --no-default-features --features mcp-http
```

`--no-default-features --features mcp-http` builds the MCP provider +
HTTP transport only: no eframe/wgpu (diagnostics), no faculties→mary/Burn.
Measured on the box (32 cores, cold build incl. crates.io downloads,
2026-07-11): 1m21s wall / ~9.8 min CPU; the source rsync itself was ~9 s
for 51 MB. Warm rebuilds: seconds. Binary: 9.1 MB dynamic ELF.

## Install

```sh
cd ~/playground-build/playground
sudo install -o root -g wheel -m 0755 target/release/playground /usr/local/bin/playground
sudo install -o root -g wheel -m 0555 deploy/freebsd/playground_mcp /usr/local/etc/rc.d/playground_mcp

# token store: root-only directory, 0600 file (mint writes it 0600 itself)
sudo mkdir -p -m 0700 /usr/local/etc/playground
# `user create` provisions the tenant's persistent jail AND mints its token.
# --jail-local runs zfs/jail directly on this host (no ssh hop).
sudo playground user create <label> --backend jail --jail-local \
  --tokens /usr/local/etc/playground/tokens.json
# the token is printed exactly once — hand it to the tenant out of band

sudo sysrc playground_mcp_enable=YES
sudo service playground_mcp start
```

The service runs as root (jail(8)/zfs(8) need it; `sudo -n` is a
pass-through for root). It binds `127.0.0.1:8377` and logs to
`/var/log/playground_mcp.log`. Restart-on-crash via `daemon -R 5`.

Note the trade-off this mode makes on a shared machine: the token store
now lives on the server (root-readable only, but root includes anyone
with root there). Under Model B a stolen tenant token reaches that
tenant's own server-born `self.pile` (seeded, append-only) and the shared
`shared.pile` — its own data and the org-shared pile, never the caller's
pile or any other pile on the host. Append-only (`chflags sappnd`,
malicious-proof once `securelevel>=1`) bounds the damage to appends, not
truncation.

## Verify (loopback round-trip)

```sh
TOK=<token>
H='Content-Type: application/json'
A="Authorization: Bearer $TOK"

# initialize — note the mcp-session-id response header
SID=$(curl -si -H "$A" -H "$H" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18"}}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8377/mcp | tr -d '\r' | awk 'tolower($1)=="mcp-session-id:"{print $2}')

# open a jail session (the caller pile_host_path is logged + ignored; the jail
# uses its own server-born self.pile at guest /pile, seeded on `user create`)
curl -s -H "$A" -H "$H" -H "Mcp-Session-Id: $SID" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"open_session","arguments":{"pile_host_path":"/ignored/by/jail-backend"}}}' http://127.0.0.1:8377/mcp

# run something in the jail (session id = playground-<tenant>); also prove the
# pile mounts are live and append-only (append lands, truncate is refused)
curl -s -H "$A" -H "$H" -H "Mcp-Session-Id: $SID" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"exec","arguments":{"session":"playground-<label>","command":"uname -a; id; ls -la /pile /shared; echo APPEND-OK >> /pile/self.pile && echo appended; (: > /pile/self.pile) 2>/dev/null || echo truncate-blocked"}}}' http://127.0.0.1:8377/mcp

# tear it down

# leftovers must be zero (jail + clone), but host piles SURVIVE (Model B):
jls name | grep '^playground-' || echo "no playground jails"
zfs list -r aitemp/playground   # only the parent + template must remain
ls /aitemp/playground/piles     # per-tenant self.pile dirs + shared/ persist
```

Interim remote use without any exposure decision: an SSH port-forward
(`ssh -L 8377:127.0.0.1:8377 ai.bultmann.eu`) gives an operator with an
ssh account the full service on their own loopback.

## DEFERRED — decisions that need JP (do not improvise these)

1. **Internet exposure.** Today: loopback only, nothing else installed.
   The options, in increasing exposure order:
   a. keep loopback + per-operator ssh forwards (works today, zero new
      surface);
   b. bind the ZeroTier address (`sysrc playground_mcp_bind=<zt-ip>:8377`)
      — reachable by ZeroTier members only; still plain HTTP, so tokens
      transit the overlay unencrypted-at-the-HTTP-layer;
   c. public: needs a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (nginx/caddy via
      pkg), a DNS name, a cert story, and a firewall pass — none of
      which exist on the box today. `--allow-origin` values must be set
      if any browser client appears.
2. **Real tenants.** Only `test-tenant` exists. Colleague tenant names,
   who mints, and how tokens are delivered (and rotated/revoked) are
   open. Token revocation currently = edit the store + restart.
3. **Template package set.** The template is stock FreeBSD 15.1 base
   (empty /usr/local). What colleagues' jails should ship (git,
   compilers, python?) is a product decision; rebuild additively (new
   snapshot), never destroy `@base` while clones may exist.
4. **Jail resource limits.** Sessions currently have no rctl/zfs-quota
   caps.
5. **Bootstrap seed contents.** Model B seeds each tenant `self.pile` and
   the `shared.pile` from `--jail-bootstrap-pile`. That seed MUST be a
   generic bootstrap with no operator memory — the shipped
   `faculties/bootstrap.pile` is the colony onboarding tour and is NOT
   generic (it still carries persona references), so it needs scrubbing
   before it can be the seed here. Who curates the seed, and how the
   `shared.pile` is synced to/from the org, are open.
